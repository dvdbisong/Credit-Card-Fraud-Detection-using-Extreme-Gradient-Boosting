# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Extreme Gradient Boosting

This project uses XGBoost from the scikit learn machine learning package in python to investigate the problem of credit card fraud detection. The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the [Machine Learning Group of ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles)](http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) on big data mining and fraud detection. The dataset is made available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud).
